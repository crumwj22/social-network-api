THis is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## User Story

SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```
